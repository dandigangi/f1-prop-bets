## F1 Prop Bets

Prop bets are small side bets on certain situations or actions taking place. This site is not for live gambling. It is just for fun. You can play on your own, friends, or against other players globally.

#### Key TODOs

[x] Create high level readme plan including stack options
[ ] First pass reading NextJS documentation
[ ] Research other stack ideas (GQL, Go, PSQL, hosting)
[ ] Design simple pages w/ mapped features/function w/ data loading strategy

More to come. Key steps to start.

#### Plan

MVP:

-   Generate a prop bet sheet page
-   Generic set of prop bets (default template)
-   Add custom bets (to default)
-   Should be printable
-   Generate a scannable, unique QR code for generated page
-   Email or share w/ others the generated page
-   Email newsletter signup

Nice to have or future:

-   Logins
-   Some kind of public feed of generated bets to show activity
-   Live updating for each week the generic bets (default template)
-   Driver/team stats; current standings
-   F1 newsfeed

#### Tech Stack

-   NextJS (TS)
-   GraphQL + TBD (Relay, Apollo, URQL, React Query)
-   Go + TBD (Gin, etc.)
-   PSQL
-   Hosting TBD (DO, Heroku, Vercel, etc.)
